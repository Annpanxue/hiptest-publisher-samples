Robot framework
===============

You'll need Robot framework installed:

    pip install robotframework

The SUT immplementation [``src/coffee_machine.py``](https://github.com/hiptest/hiptest-publisher-samples/blob/master/robotframework/src/coffee_machine.py) (yep it's the same implementation than for Python)

Note that we did not use the keywords generated by Hiptest publisher but made our own Python implementation. This is mainly due to the fact that our knowledge of Robot framework is pretty limited and it was the quicker way to get the example running.

If you have a better knowledge of Robot framework, do not hesitate to contribute and implement the action words in a more "robot framework"ish way. The action words skeleton can be generated using the command:

    hiptest-publisher -c robotframework.conf --actionwords-only



To run the tests:

    pybot -P src:tests tests/test_*

To update the tests:

    hiptest-publisher -c robotframework.conf --split-scenarios --test-only

The tests are generated in the [``tests``](https://github.com/hiptest/hiptest-publisher-samples/blob/master/robotframework/tests/) folder.
