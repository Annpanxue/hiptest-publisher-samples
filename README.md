Zest publisher: samples
=======================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Smartesting/zest-publisher-samples.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Smartesting/zest-publisher-samples)

In this repository you'll find tests generated from [Zest](https://www.zest-testing.com), using [Zest publisher](https://github.com/Smartesting/zest-publisher).

The goals are:

 * to show how tests are exported in the various languages
 * to test export in various languages and frameworks
 * to check exports work out of the box (well, with implemented actionwords)

System under test
------------------

The SUT is a (not that much) simple coffee machine. You start it, you ask for a coffee and you get it, sometimes. But most of times you have to add water or beans, empty the grounds. You have an automatic expresso machine at work or at home? So you know how it goes :-)

Languages
----------

Each supported language by Zest publisher has some examples:

 - [Python](https://github.com/Smartesting/zest-publisher-samples/blob/master/python/README.md)

 - Java: [JUnit](https://github.com/Smartesting/zest-publisher-samples/blob/master/java-junit/README.md) / [Test Ng](https://github.com/Smartesting/zest-publisher-samples/blob/master/java-testng/README.md)
 - [Robot framework](https://github.com/Smartesting/zest-publisher-samples/blob/master/robotframework/README.md)
 - [Selenium IDE](https://github.com/Smartesting/zest-publisher-samples/blob/master/javascript/selenium-ide/README.md)
